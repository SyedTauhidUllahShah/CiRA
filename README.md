# CiRA-Causality-Detection-in-Requirement-Artifacts
System behavior is often expressed by causal relations in requirements (e.g. if event 1, then event 2). Automatically extracting this embedded causal knowledge supports not only reasoning about requirements dependencies, but also various automated engineering tasks such as seamless derivation of test cases. However, causality extraction from natural language (NL) is still an open research challenge as existing approaches fail to extract causality with reasonable performance. We understand causality extraction from requirements as a two step problem: First, we need to detect if requirements have causal properties or not, and then we need to understand and extract their causal relations. We developed a tool-supported approach for causality detection (CiRA, standing for Causality in Requirements Artifacts). This constitutes a first step towards causality extraction from NL requirements. Feel free to re-use our code :) 

This repository contains our code and annotated data sets used in our case study (see paper "Automatic Detection of Causality in Requirement Artifacts: the CiRA Approach")
